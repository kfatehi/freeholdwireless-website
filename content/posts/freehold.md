Freehold Wireless is a fledgling effort to respond to the regional monopolies of the telecoms positively and productively. For far too long, we have allowed the telecoms to rule our internetworked lives. If you pay the bill each month, I don't have to explain to you that this is not hyperbole.

## Competition Never Came (And Won't)

Every so often we might check for alternatives and find that, no, Google Fiber never came. No, nobody came to compete. Why? Because telecom companies were designed as regional monopolies. This was done on purpose and is not changing anytime soon. We will be lied to over and over again, for years and years. It's just not profitable for the telcos to care, or for newcomers to try and enter these non-lucrative markets.

So then what are we left to do if we want to stop being extorted? Boycott the cable company and tether to our phones? Guess what, you have similar problems there. Are we left without any options? Yes, kind of... Interestingly, alternative choices do show up, once you begin thinking in terms of a community. I know we are not used to this anymore. We live in a time when neighbors might hardly interact with each other, but if we rebuild our community bonds, we can change the telco stranglehold from the ground up. 

By leveraging the force of our community bonds with clever deployment of modern networking technology, we can take back the control that is rightly ours (and that the telcos have shown they do not deserve to keep). Although competitors would have made this an amicable situation before, they never came, and at this point we must not place faith in new masters anyway. Instead, Freehold's vision is to place faith in ourselves, in our communities, by cultivating bonds we have long neglected, starting with the network. This is the only reasonable alternative in such an anti-competitive space. That is, sovereignty through community organization.

## Beyond Simply Fast Internet

In the event of emergency, are we going to rely on the masters for communications? No. We must become sovereign through deployment of fixed wireless technologies. For a fraction of the cost of your monthly cable bill, you can deploy a fixed wireless antenna on your roof, point it at your nearest neighbor, and join the network.

Join us in developing the future of resilient, sovereign connectivity. What we need to get this project going is your interest and commitment to the mission and values. Join the newsletter to receive weekly progress updates and future calls to action as we lay the groundwork for making this a reality, finally. We have waited long enough, nobody is coming, it's time for us to take matters into our own hands by developing our own networks.

The progress of Freehold Wireless, including all documentation, software, hardware, architecture, and so on, will be released as open source on this website for other communities to use and help each other maintain and improve our networks and best practices.
